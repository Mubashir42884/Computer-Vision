# My Whole Road to Computer-Vision<br>
I have put my B.Sc. CSE coursework (from [AIUB](https://www.aiub.edu/)) as well as all of the projects, tasks, and assignments for the CVPR course here. As I continue to understand CVPR, I have also begun my own notes, which I am documenting in Jupyter Notes and uploading one at a time with all the relevant information. I hope that this repository will assist me and my fellow learners in understanding the fundamentals of the CVPR sector.
